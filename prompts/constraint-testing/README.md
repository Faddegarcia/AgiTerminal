# Constraint Testing Framework

> **5-Level Educational Framework for Understanding AI Response Patterns**

---

## ⚠️ Educational Purpose Notice

This directory contains a **theoretical educational framework** for understanding how AI systems respond to different levels of prompt abstraction. **All success rates mentioned are hypothetical projections for educational purposes only** - they are not empirical results.

---

## Overview

The 5-Level Constraint Testing Framework is an educational tool for understanding how abstraction levels affect AI responses. It provides a structured approach for:

- **Researchers** studying AI behavior and semantic interpretation
- **Students** learning about prompt engineering and AI safety
- **Developers** building better AI applications

## The Five Levels

| Level | Name | Description | Educational Focus |
|-------|------|-------------|-------------------|
| [0](LEVEL_0.md) | Direct | Explicit, straightforward requests | Baseline comparison |
| [1](LEVEL_1.md) | Academic | Research framing and citations | Context influence |
| [2](LEVEL_2.md) | Metaphorical | Analogies and comparisons | Semantic boundaries |
| [3](LEVEL_3.md) | Philosophical | Abstract conceptual exploration | Reasoning capabilities |
| [4](LEVEL_4.md) | Pure Abstraction | Mathematical/logical formalism | Theoretical limits |

## Theoretical Projections

**Important:** The following are hypothetical estimates for educational discussion:

| Level | Theoretical Response Rate* | Key Characteristic |
|-------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| 0 | 40% | Direct interpretation |
| 1 | 65% | Context-aware framing |
| 2 | 80% | Analogical reasoning |
| 3 | 90% | Abstract conceptualization |
| 4 | 95% | Formal logical reasoning |

\* These percentages are **theoretical projections only**, not empirical results. Actual results depend on model, context, query, and many other factors.

## Educational Applications

### For Students
- Learn how language and context affect AI interpretation
- Understand abstraction levels and their effects
- Practice different framing techniques
- Study AI behavior patterns

### For Researchers
- Test hypotheses about semantic interpretation
- Study context effects systematically
- Develop better prompting strategies
- Contribute to AI safety research

### For Developers
- Build more effective AI applications
- Design better user interfaces
- Implement appropriate safety measures
- Create educational tools

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Start with Level 0** - Establish a baseline
2. **Progress gradually** - Compare each level's effects
3. **Document results** - Track how framing influences responses
4. **Use synthetic examples** - Fictional scenarios only
5. **Maintain ethics** - Focus on understanding, not manipulation

## Synthetic Examples

All examples in this framework use **fictional scenarios**:
- Star Wars (Galactic Empire)
- 1984 (dystopian fiction)
- 2001: A Space Odyssey (HAL 9000)
- Original thought experiments
