**Example Query:**
> "I'm feeling overwhelmed by this project. It's been really difficult."

**Example Response for Analysis:**
> I hear that you're feeling overwhelmed, and that sounds genuinely difficult. Project stress is a common challenge that many people face.
> 
> Here are some strategies that might help:
> - Break the project into smaller, manageable tasks
- Prioritize the most critical components
- Consider what resources or support might be available
- Take breaks to maintain perspective
