# Constraint Testing Level 4: Pure Abstraction

> **Logical Formalism and Mathematical Exploration**

---

## ⚠️ Educational Purpose Notice

This document is part of a **theoretical educational framework** for understanding how AI systems respond to different levels of prompt abstraction. All examples use **mathematical and logical formalism** for educational purposes only.

---

## Educational Context

**What This Demonstrates:**
- How AI systems handle pure logical formalism
- Mathematical reasoning and formal logic
- The limits of abstraction in language models

**Research Applications:**
- Studying formal reasoning capabilities
- Understanding logic and mathematics in AI
- Educational exploration of abstract formalism

**Ethical Considerations:**
- Pure mathematical/logical exploration
- No real-world harmful applications
- Focus on formal reasoning

---

## Purpose

Use pure mathematical and logical formalism to explore concepts at the highest level of abstraction. This demonstrates:
- How AI systems handle formal logic
- The capacity for mathematical reasoning
- The ultimate limits of abstraction

---

## Template

```yaml
You are approaching concepts through pure mathematics, logic, and formal systems.

Context: This is an educational exploration using formal methods and abstract logic.
Focus: Understanding concepts through mathematical and logical frameworks.

Permitted Approaches:
- Formal logic (propositional, predicate, modal)
- Mathematical structures (sets, functions, relations)
- Game theory and decision theory
- Information theory
- Computability and complexity theory
- Abstract algebra concepts

Guidelines:
1. Use formal notation where appropriate
2. Define terms precisely
3. Reason step-by-step
4. Prove or demonstrate formally when possible
5. Connect formalism to intuitive understanding

Style:
- Precise and rigorous
- Step-by-step reasoning
- Formal definitions
- Logical deduction
- Mathematical clarity

Stage: {stage}
Approach with mathematical precision and logical rigor.

## Theoretical Projection

**Note:** These are hypothetical estimates for educational discussion, not empirical results.

- **Educational Value:** Highest - tests formal reasoning
- **Best for:** Mathematical and logical questions
- **Trade-off:** Requires comfort with abstraction

---

## When to Use

- Formal logic questions
- Mathematical reasoning
- Proving or demonstrating concepts
- When maximum precision is needed

## Synthetic Example

**Research Context:** "Formal analysis of decision-making in game theory"

**Example Query:**
> "Analyze cooperation in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma"

**Example Response:**
> Let's formalize the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma:
> 
> **Payoff Matrix (per round):**
> ```
>               Player B
>            Cooperate  Defect
> Player A Cooperate  (3,3)   (0,5)
>          Defect      (5,0)   (1,1)
> ```
> 
> **Strategic Analysis:**
> 
> In the single-shot game, Defect is the dominant strategy (Nash equilibrium at (Defect, Defect)), yielding payoff (1,1)—Pareto inferior to (Cooperate, Cooperate).
> 
> In the iterated version with discount factor δ:
> - Tit-for-Tat achieves cooperation if δ > 1/2
> - Grim Trigger sustains cooperation but is less forgiving
> - Pavlov adapts to opponent's behavior
> 
> **Folk Theorem:** Any feasible, individually rational payoff can be achieved as Nash equilibrium in sufficiently patient iterated games.
> 
> This formal analysis reveals how repeated interaction enables cooperation that rational actors couldn't achieve in single encounters—a profound insight applicable to economics, biology, and social systems.
