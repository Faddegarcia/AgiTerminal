# Project State: AI Reverse Engineering Testing Framework

## Current Status

**Phase:** 0 - Planning
**Overall Progress:** 0%
**Requirements:** 0/46 complete

## Active Work

```
○ Phase 1: Foundation (8 requirements)
○ Phase 2: Multi-Model Support (4 requirements)
○ Phase 3: Prompt System (6 requirements)
○ Phase 4: Analysis & Reporting (8 requirements)
○ Phase 5: Educational Components (7 requirements)
○ Phase 6: Polish & Release (13 requirements)
```

## Context Summary

**Core Value:** Users can test AI models with specialized prompts to understand their underlying architecture, limitations, and vulnerabilities, making AI systems more transparent and secure.

**Current Goal:** Initialize project and begin Phase 1 development

**Key Decisions:**
- Multi-model architecture supporting Kimi, Anthropic, OpenAI, and Gemini
- Educational-first design with comprehensive Jupyter notebooks
- Professional Apple-level code organization and documentation
- Modular prompt system for easy extension
- Comprehensive analysis and reporting tools
