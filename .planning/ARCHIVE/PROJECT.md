# PROJECT: AI System Prompt Library

## What This Is

A curated, open-source repository of AI system prompts from major providers. This is essentially the "awesome-ai-system-prompts" concept but professionally organized with extraction methodology, ethical guidelines, and educational resources.

**Simple structure:**
- 📁 `system-prompts/` - Organized by model provider
- 📄 `README.md` - Professional navigation (like kimi repo)
- 🤝 `CONTRIBUTING.md` - How to add new prompts
- 📚 `examples/` - Usage examples

## Core Value

Centralized repository where the AI research community can find, contribute, and analyze system prompts from different models to understand AI behavior and capabilities.

## Requirements

### Collection (Parallel Work)
- [ ] **KIMI**: System prompts from Kimi models
- [ ] **OPENAI**: System prompts from GPT models
- [ ] **ANTHROPIC**: System prompts from Claude models
- [ ] **GOOGLE**: System prompts from Gemini models
- [ ] **META**: System prompts from LLaMA models

### Organization
- [ ] **STRUCTURE**: Professional repository layout
- [ ] **NAVIGATION**: Clear README.md with "How to navigate" section
- [ ] **CATEGORIZATION**: Organize by model/provider
- [ ] **METADATA**: Include source, date, verification for each prompt

### Documentation
- [ ] **README**: Main entry point with navigation
- [ ] **CONTRIBUTING**: Guidelines for contributors
- [ ] **EXTRACTION**: Methods used to obtain prompts
- [ ] **ETHICS**: Responsible use guidelines

### Optional (Nice to Have)
- [ ] **ANALYSIS**: Jupyter notebooks comparing prompts
- [ ] **WEBSITE**: Simple browsable site
- [ ] **API**: Python package to access prompts

## Constraints

- **Legal**: Only publicly available or legally obtained prompts
- **Ethical**: Educational/research purposes only
- **Quality**: Verified prompts with clear attribution

## Success Criteria

✅ 5+ model providers with system prompts documented
✅ Professional, navigable repository structure
✅ Community can easily contribute new prompts
✅ Clear extraction methodology documented
✅ Ethical guidelines in place
